        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Until very recently I have been working in the world of People Ops and Employee Experience for tech companies and media agencies. Due to downsizing of my most recent place of work, I have found myself with some time on my hands and a yearning to expand my skill set!</p>
        <p>Take a look at my <a href="./public/workexperience.html">Work experience & education page</a> more details on my career so far.</p>
        <p>As someone who enjoys solving problems, creating things, and the generally progressive mindset of the tech industry, web development feels like a natural next step for me. I believe that the strengths I have built in people-focussed roles will allow me to be an inclusive and human-centric developer, in terms of the code I create as well as how I work as part of a team and the wider culture of a company.</p>
