    <h1>Working with me</h1>
    <hr/>
        <p>My preferred styles of working, aka how to help me do my best work!</p>
    <h2>Communication style</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I prefer asynchronous written communication for anything process driven, particularly when providing clarifications or context, so that I am able to refer to it later.</li>
        <li>I also love face to face communication but this tends to work better for me for looser structured conversations, ideation, and general socialising.</li>
        <li>Feel free to schedule meetings with me whenever you want/need to chat – I prefer knowing the topics in advance if possible.</li>
        <li>Slack is the quickest way to get a response from me. I don't mind being contacted at any time but I will likely only respond during week daytimes.</li>
        <li>I like expectations to be clear and direct - I prefer not needing to read between the lines.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things I need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Time to think things through, researching ideas and gathering feedback before jumping to decision making mode, particularly for anything that affects people and culture</li>
        <li>When starting something new, I like to have upfront detail and context - visuals alongside a written explanation is helpful. </li>
        <li>Knowing the purpose behind why we are doing something as this helps me to engage with it. </li>
        <li>Time to reflect and a couple of brain-breaks during the day to avoid getting overwhelmed by information overload. I have sensory processing sensitivity so taking these moments to decompress and process my thoughts is essential.</li>
        <li>I find it easier to concentrate on deep work in the late morning/afternoon so I tend to focus on larger projects and deep work during this time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things I like</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Design thinking for process improvements.</li>
        <li>Coaching techniques for people empowerment.</li>
        <li>Improving my knowledge by attending webinars / conferences and reading books about culture, wellbeing, and coaching.</li>
        <li>Active listening and nurturing an environment that is inclusive and psychologically safe.</li>
        <li>Mental health awareness and open conversations around wellbeing.</li>
        <li>Getting to know people, what they are passionate about, and sharing things about my life outside of work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The ways I like to receive feedback</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I like timely feedback with specific examples and suggestions on how I / it could be better / different.</li>
        <li>Face to face delivery works best for me but I prefer to be asked whether I am in a good head space to receive feedback beforehand, and some context ahead of time is also useful for me.</li>
        <li>I see all feedback as a learning tool and would rather have a conversation than things be unspoken.</li>
    </ul>
