    <h1>Hobbies & interests</h1>
<hr/>
    <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>My main hobby is painting. I have tried a lot of different styles and mediums over the years but always come back to something strong, bright, and acrylic based.</p>

    <h2>Dancing</h2>
        <p>In January 2023 I started dancing again for the first time in 10 years and I've been having such a fun time and building my confidence - I even performed in a show with our new 'beginners crew' in July!</p>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>Mostly I am guilty of buying more books than I can ever read...! But I do love reading, whether that is getting lost in a great story or learning something new - ideally both!</p>
        <p>Some of my favourites are:</p>
